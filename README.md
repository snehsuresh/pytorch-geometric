##Pytorch Geometric => Build Graph Neural Network
##RDKit => Handle Molecule Data
Note: Currently I didn't find a way to set a specific python version in colab. However, when installing rdkit, only specific python versions are supported... Hence it cannot be ensured that the notebook runs properly. For example Python 3.7.10 is not supported.
